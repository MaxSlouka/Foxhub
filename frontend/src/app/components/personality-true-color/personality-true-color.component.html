            <p class="lead">The True Color Personality Test is a popular psychological tool used to assess and
                categorize individual personalities based on color preferences. It is a simplified version of the
                Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and other similar tests. The concept behind the True Color
                Personality Test is to assign one of four primary colors (blue, green, gold, or orange) to represent
                different personality types.</p>
            <p class="lead">Each color represents a distinct set of traits and behaviors.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p class="lead">Blue: Represents people who are typically empathetic, sensitive, and nurturing. They
                        value harmony and emotional connections in their relationships.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="lead">Green: Represents individuals who are analytical, logical, and detail-oriented. They
                        excel in problem-solving and enjoy learning and innovation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="lead">Gold: Represents people who are reliable, organized, and responsible. They are often
                        goal-oriented and value stability and tradition.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="lead">Orange: Represents individuals who are adventurous, spontaneous, and energetic. They
                        thrive on excitement and prefer a dynamic, fast-paced lifestyle.</p>
